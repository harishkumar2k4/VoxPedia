# VoxPedia
VoxPedia is a voice-enabled chatbot that provides answers grounded in external data. It processes spoken queries through a single pipeline by following a step-by-step workflow: first, listening to and transcribing the audio; second, translating the query; and finally, searching for and using relevant facts to generate an accurate response.
